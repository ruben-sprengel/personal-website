# Security Policy

Security is important for us.

## Supported Versions

The latest version of `personal-website` is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an Github Message or LinkedIn Message to @ruben-sprengel . Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability.

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
