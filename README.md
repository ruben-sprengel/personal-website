## üöÄ Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that runs automatically with every pull request and push to the main branch. This ensures that the code is consistent, high-quality, and free of obvious errors.

- The CI pipeline is located in the .github/workflows/svelte-ci.yml file and performs the following steps:
- Checkout Code: Fetches the current code from the repository.
- Node.js Setup: Sets up the required Node.js version (v22).
- Cache Node Modules: Uses GitHub Actions Caching to cache dependencies between runs and reduce installation time.
- Install Dependencies: Installs all dependencies with npm ci based on the package-lock.json file.
- Linting: Runs the linter to check for code formatting and potential style errors.
- Svelte Check: Checks the code for type and syntax errors to ensure it's compatible with the Svelte compiler configuration.
- Security Audit: Scans project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and fails if critical issues are found.
- Build: Runs a full build of the application to ensure production artifacts can be created without errors.

A merge into the main branch is only possible if all of these checks have been completed successfully.
